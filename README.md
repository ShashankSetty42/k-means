# K-Means algorithm (Python)

A simple python code that implements the K-Means algorithm

#### Files:
- `kmeans.py` - is the main file containing all the logic for k-means algorithm

#### How to run:
1. ###### Requirements : 
    - input file that contains a list of co-ordinates like `co-ordinate1,co-ordinate2` each point should be in a new line and each axis value is separated with a comma
2. ###### The code has 3 arguments that you need to provide

    -  `-h` For help menu
    - `-i` The number of iterations you want to run the algorithm
    - `-c` The number of centroids you want to try with
    - `-f` The input file that contains the coordinate
    
3. Once all the requirements are satisfied you can run the code using `python3 kmeans.py [args]`
